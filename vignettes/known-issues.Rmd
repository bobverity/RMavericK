### Timezone warning on installation

```
Warning message:
In strptime(x, fmt, tz = "GMT") :
  unknown timezone 'default/Europe/Brussels'
```

*rmaverick* appears to take issue with certain timezones. This prevents various timers from working, which in turn stops the package from being installed.

A known solution is to use the `Sys.setenv()` function to set the timezone manually at the beginning of a script. The "Europe/Berlin" is known to work.
